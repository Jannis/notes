# Interesting Libraries

## Web Development / JavaScript / TypeScript

- [Thi.ng](https://thi.ng)
  - Specifically `thi.ng/rdom`, `thi.ng/rdom-components`, `thi.ng/rstream` and `thi.ng/transducers`.
- [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/)
  - Alternative to Apollo.
- [evt](https://www.evt.land/)
  - Better TypeScript alternative to EventEmitter.

## Stress Testing / Benchmarking

- [AutoCannon](https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon/) - JS tool and library
  similar to `siege` or `wrk` but usable as a library, making it a lot more
  flexible for stress testing with custom requests and own statistics.
